This program implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. It takes its input graph from a text file and finds the shortest path from the source vertex to every other vertex. By default, this program takes the first vertex as the source. The input in the file is given in a specific format, for e.g. if a row reads "4	3,3 7,7", this means that the vertex 4 has an edge to the vertex 3 of length 3, and an edge of length 7 to the vertex 7.
