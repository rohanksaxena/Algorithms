This is a straightforward O(mn) time implementation of Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm, where
 n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in the graph. The first row of the input 
 file contains the number of vertices and edges, and successive rows contain the ends of edges and 
 their weights.
